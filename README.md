# Summary

This project allowed me to work on transforming user data into a tabular format for readability and organization. Displaying data in a tabular fashion is a tool used widely throughout the web and important for storing data and abstracting from it. At a surface level, we can extract simple patterns from having a record of our expenses and viewing them in tabular form. In a more technical manner, I enjoyed learning how to programatically generate new rows of data via user form submission.

- Detailed Features:
    - Table with remove button for each expense.
    - HTML form for submitting user data to table.
